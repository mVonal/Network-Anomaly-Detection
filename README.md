# Network Anomaly Detection with Random Forests

This project implements a machine learning–based network anomaly detection system
using a Random Forest classifier trained on the NSL-KDD dataset.

The goal is to classify network traffic as normal or as one of several attack
categories, including DoS, Probe, Privilege Escalation, and Access attacks.

## Dataset

This project uses the **NSL-KDD dataset**, a refined version of the original
KDD Cup 1999 dataset, designed to reduce redundancy and class imbalance.

You must manually download the dataset and place the `KDD+.txt` file
in the project root directory.
